# Git Battle

This app is an exercise to test my skills on React JS.
It was created using Github API with 2 different usernames. The app has
an algorithm which will tell the user who has the best account in terms of
followers.

### Usage
```
   $ npm install
```

```
   $ npm start
```

Then it will redirect you to the localhost , https//:localhost:3000
